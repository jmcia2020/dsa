What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### API

Public Classes in Linked Lists.cs include:

| LinkedList | Node Head | Insert | Include| ToSring |

## Insertions

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

`.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
`.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
`.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
